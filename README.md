Hey, thanks for stopping by.

What you see here is a bot, that needed no coding, no botghost and was made with python.

And what this project REALLY is. Itâ€™s a botghost-like bot, but with no watermarks and only useful features.

# HOW TO SETUP

To setup this bot, all you have to do is to run the setup.py file and it will do everything for you. (Make sure you created a bot with all intents enabled at https://discord.com/developers/applications )
