# WARNING: THIS PROJECT IS IN BETA AND NOT FINISHED

Hey, thanks for stopping by.

What you see here is a bot, that needed no coding, no botghost and was made with python.

And what this project REALLY is. Itâ€™s a botghost-like bot, but with no watermarks and only useful features.

# HOW TO SETUP

To setup this bot, all you have to do is to run the setup.py file and it will do everything for you. (Make sure you created a bot with all intents enabled at https://discord.com/developers/applications )

# Hosting.

For hosting, the script will run on your computer as main.py

If you want to host it on your VPS or something, just transfer the main.py file to your server or VPS (whatever it is)
